  This is the function that never ends
  Yes, it just goes on and on my friends.
  Some people started computing it, not knowing what it was.
  And they'll continue computing it forever just because,
  This is the function that never ends.

  <script>
    while (true) {
      for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) ;
    }
  </script>
